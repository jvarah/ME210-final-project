# ME210-final-project
Code for the final project for ME210, Intro to Mechatronics, Winter 2023

The following code was developed over the period of three weeks, ending with the final showcase on Sunday, March 12th, 2023.
The code is unmodified from long work sessions, with hasty tweaks to fix our robot quickly. Because of those tweaks, it is not a great example of good programming style or event-driven programming, but it works!

Given more time, we would have tested and tuned PID line follow (rather than our binary approach) to speed up our cycles to depositing press (ping pong balls).

# Setup
Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jvarah/ME210-final-project.git) and then open the folder with the PlatformIO extension for VS Code. A build of main should have no errors.

# Final report
See `final-report/` for our images and html file to be published to the ME210 website
